We find that all four sectors have become highly interrelated over the past decade, increasing the level of systemic risk in the finance and insurance industries.  These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods, and seem to contain predictive power for the current financial crisis.  Our results suggest that hedge funds can provide early indications of market dislocation, and systemic risk arises from a complex and dynamic network of relationships among hedge funds, banks, insurance companies, and brokers.}

abstract="To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying important biological processes, a detailed description of the gene products networks involved is required. In order to define and understand such molecular networks, some statistical methods are proposed in the literature to estimate gene regulatory networks from time-series microarray data. However, several problems still need to be overcome. Firstly, information flow need to be inferred, in addition to the correlation between genes. Secondly, we usually try to identify large networks from a large number of genes (parameters) originating from a smaller number of microarray experiments (samples). Due to this situation, which is rather frequent in Bioinformatics, it is difficult to perform statistical tests using methods that model large gene-gene networks. In addition, most of the models are based on dimension reduction using clustering techniques, therefore, the resulting network is not a gene-gene network but a module-module network. Here, we present the Sparse Vector Autoregressive model as a solution to these problems.",

abstract={Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are important abstractions of the complex regulatory interplays between genes, proteins, metabolites, and other molecular-level entities. Comprehensive GRNs provide high-level overviews of the topology of gene-gene interactions and their purposes, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of their role in phenotypic variation, disease mechanisms, and other biological processes and how they may be perturbed for therapeutic purposes. With pathway analysis methods, GRNs can be used to glean mechanistic insights and derive meaning from high-throughput measurements in a knowledge-driven manner, allowing for the identification of pathways underlying processes and complex diseases as well as potential treatment targets. However, many GRNs are only partially known, and constructing accurate GRNs from gene expression data remains a challenge, complicated by problems such as small sample sizes, gene expression stochasticity, and incomplete characterizations of the gene regulatory dynamics. Here we present two methods for GRN reconstruction from time-course gene expression data. For the first, we develop a semi-supervised method that enables the synthesis of information from partially known networks with time-course data. This approach adapts PLS-VIP for time-course data and uses reference networks to simulate expression data from which null distributions of VIP scores are generated to estimate edge probabilities for input expression data. By using simulated dynamics to generate reference distributions, this approach incorporates previously known regulatory relationships and links the network to the dynamics to derive posterior networks and discover novel and anomalous connections. For the second approach, we adapt the time-lagged Ordered Lasso, a regularized regression method with temporal monotonicity constraints, for de novo and semi-supervised reconstruction by assuming that the regulatory strength of a gene diminishes with increasing temporal distance. We show that this constraint imbues favorable properties to improve prediction accuracy and that these methods can discover novel regulatory dependencies in existing pathways and produce accurate networks subject to the dynamics and assumptions of the time-lagged Ordered Lasso. In the Appendix, we introduce preliminary work for a method to identify significantly altered pathways based on their spectral properties. We describe an approach that assesses the alterations to a GRN across different phenotypic conditions based on the changes in the propagation of a gene expression signal and network-wide connectivity that are encoded by the graph Laplacian. Importantly, this method allows graphs to be signed by using equivalent unsigned representations that are compatible with the graph Laplacian to analyze GRNs based on the magnitudes of association between genes as well as the nature of those associations. We present theoretical results and preliminary applications of this method and discuss future directions to enhance the approach.},

Such information can be used to improve estimation and inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular mechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an important problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time provides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are affected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore be used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.Results: In this article, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating lasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression data. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying time series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators. Moreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between activation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We provide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show that the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the large p, small n setting. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples.Availability: The proposed truncating lasso method is implemented in the R-package ‘grangerTlasso’ and is freely available at http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/∼shojaie/Contact:shojaie@umich.edu}",

In this paper, we study the Lasso estimator for fitting autoregressive time series models. We adopt a double asymptotic framework where the maximal lag may increase with the sample size. We derive theoretical results establishing various types of consistency. In particular, we derive conditions under which the Lasso estimator for the autoregressive coefficients is model selection consistent, estimation consistent and prediction consistent. Simulation study results are reported."

One of the major obstacles in developing and evaluating approaches for de-novo gene network reconstruction is the absence of high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions. To establish a foundation for assessing the accuracy of de-novo gene network reverse-engineering, we constructed high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporate binding and gene knockout data. Then we used 7 performance metrics to assess accuracy of 18 statistical association-based approaches for de-novo network reverse-engineering in 13 different datasets spanning over 4 data types. We found that most reconstructed networks had statistically significant accuracies. We also determined which statistical approaches and datasets/data types lead to networks with better reconstruction accuracies. While we found that de-novo reverse-engineering of the entire network is a challenging problem, it is possible to reconstruct sub-networks around some transcription factors with good accuracy. The latter transcription factors can be identified by assessing their connectivity in the inferred networks. Overall, this study provides the gene network reverse-engineering community with a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of S. cerevisiae gene network reconstruction and variability in performance of various approaches for learning both the entire network and sub-networks around transcription factors.},

abstract = "In this thesis we study dynamical systems that consist of interconnected subsystems. We address the problem of relating the network of subsystems to statistical properties of the output process of the dynamical system. The considered systems are: linear time invariant state-space (LTI–SS) representation, LTI transfer matrix and general bilinear state-space (GB–SS) representation. The network of subsystems of the dynamical system is represented by a directed graph that we call network graph whose nodes correspond to the subsystems and whose edges correspond to the directed communication between the subsystems. The statistical property of the output process is, in LTI systems, the so-called conditional and unconditional Granger causality and, in GB–SS representation, the so called GB–Granger causality.The main results of this thesis provide formal relationship between the network of subsystems of a dynamical system and the above-mentioned statistical properties of its output process. The thesis also introduces realization and identification algorithms for constructing the dynamical systems under consideration. The results can be of interest in application in e.g., systems biology, neuroscience, and economics.",
