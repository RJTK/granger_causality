Main points to cover:
- What is Granger-causality and why should we care?
  - Definition and heuristic explanation
  - Brief history on economic applications
  - Examples of applications
    - Neuroscience with some nice figures and explanation
    - Gene networks
    - (Idea) on "rationality testing" in a sequential game
    - Financial connectedness
- Special cases and formulas
  - VAR(1)
  - VAR(\infty)
  - Transfer entropy / multigraph example for why linear models make
    life easier ?
  - Expansion as 
- Notion of the causation graph
  - Quick definitions on parents, ancestors, paths.
  - Note that we are mostly interested in cases where the system is
    large (dozens or hundreds of nodes)
- The LASSO and adaLASSO briefly
  - Extremely common to apply this in applications on Granger
    causality or on papers which do simulation studies
  - Theorems on recovery for ordinary linear regression
    - Emphasize the importance of the sparsity rate as a parameter
      governing recovery probability
  - Theorems as adapted to a time-series case
    - point out it has nothing to do with graph structure, it is just
      a modification which works for the time series case.
- Look at some sorts of causality graph topologies as examples of how
  wildly different the graphs can look while still having the same
  sparsity rate?
- Pairwise causality
  - Intuitive confounding problems
  - Notion of confounders
  - Prop 4 on necessary conditions; note that these hold in /any/ graph
    - Special case of DAG?  Corollary 1
  - Why a converse to prop 4 is not direct
    - The converse is often taken for granted when discussing confounding
- Strongly causal graphs
  - Prop 6, the partial converse to prop 4.
    - Note that to obtain this we needed /only/ some topological assumptions
    - Corollary 4 that seems to be so obviously
- Difficulty of completing the converse
  - Persistence condition
  - The big T(z) filter and cancellation
  - Completed converse
- Recovery via pairwise tests alone
  - The algorithm and the idea
  - The example
- Simulation results
  - Notice that the LASSO seems to perform slightly better on the SCG
    in comparison to the DAG with a comparable number of edges
- Conclusions
